<h1 style="margin-top: 0px;">ABOUT</h1>
I’m Tom. I’m a 32 year old dude, who after roughly 10 years of successful career is taking partially some time off to focus on family and this Q4I website project. I consider myself one the luckiest persons on Earth.

I didn’t win the lottery, I don’t drive a fancy car, and I’m not super famous. What I do have is a beautiful wife, two amazing children, a loving family, and a line of work that allows me to spend most of my time on things I love - teaching others and learning myself.

## MY STORY
I studied in North America and Europe (altogether 4 different countries). While I loved being a student, I couldn't wait to become independent from my parents.

At university, I was super excited about the first "real" jobs I was able to get. Internship at a bank. Market Research and then, later, New Business Development roles at a telecom company. Always hungry to learn more. Always eager to get more reponsibilities. This was exciting and very rewarding.

Already at that time I got managerial reponsibilities and had to hire a team of 9 people. A great experience in terms of being on the other end of the job interviews. Also later, after graduation, at a large global technology company had an opportunity to interview candidates for internships.

Couple of years down the road, working as a director in a new technology venture, I was interviewing and hiring candidates for expert and senior roles. This included working with headhunting company as well.

Thinking back about all these experiences, I often had a feeling that some of the candidates were otherwise good, but didn't seem to do enough research about the company and ask right questions during the interviews. They didn't get the job.

## SO WHY QUESTIONS FOR INTERVIEWER?
With this website, I want to explore and, as much as possibe, uncover often _overlooked things_. Things that can make you a successful job applicant. My own experience, thoughts and opinions of others that I collect here - it's all out there for you to see. I’m not trying to show off my success – that’s definitely not my purpose. **If you’re looking for your first real jobs or planning to, I hope that what I share here can help you reach your goals.**

**If you're not looking for a job right now, but thinking about different opportunities for you in the future, you can get insights about wide range of companies and industries. This can help you make decision on your own about the direction you want to take.**

Like I say, I'm here to ask interviewers questions you'd like to hear answers to.

Please feel free to subscribe to my newsletter below and get notified as soon as I have more insights to share.

_And finally, please read this carefully:_

I don’t consider myself an HR or recruiting guru, the things I cover on Q4I website are not secrets and the kinds of things I teach are not psychological tricks  – far from it actually.

This is why you won’t see me offer any paid consultations  – not because I don’t want to help, but because honestly most of the information I could give you can be found for free here on my website or elsewhere online. If you need some help figuring stuff out, just use my contact form (at the bottom of the page) to send me an email and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.

Getting the job you want takes **a lot** of hard work, **a lot** of patience, practice and a little bit of **luck** too, although I honestly believe we create our own luck.

I know I have useful experience and insights to share, however I want to do it the right way. I speak only from my experience or I ask others who are more knowledgeable than me, to share their opinions. Please don’t feel like you owe me anything because of it. This is my way of paying forward the amazing things that have happened to me.

You won’t get any hard sells from me, long sales pages or fluffed up stuff – just real life case studies and recommendations based on my own experience with preparing for and getting first real jobs.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope to see you on the Q4I website sometime soon!

Cheers!
