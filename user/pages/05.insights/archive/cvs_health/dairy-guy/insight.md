PEP: Tell us about your role at CVS Health. What is it like day-to-day?

I lead CVS Health's Health Plan business, charged with delivering the full breadth of our companies capabilities to the Health Plan marketplace (which includes HMOs, insurance companies and other health care payers). The breadth and scope of my role is what makes it so much fun. My work day to day can range from very narrowly focused work on a single customer or operational area, to long term strategy and M&A opportunities.
