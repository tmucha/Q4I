During the interview process, it is important to remember that many companies use their Human Resources to do the hiring and firing of employees. Who you sit down with at your interview may not be the person that you'll directly report to. 

If this is the case, asking a few strategic questions at the end of your interview could net you a wealth of information that will be beneficial to you as you move to the next stage of the interviews or begin your new job.

#### Direct Supervisor Questions
Asking the Human Resources interviewer who your direct supervisor is should be a no-brainer. You are interested in the position, and that includes who your boss will be. 

However, asking the interviewer to expand upon this, and to explain a little more about your supervisor's personality is very important, especially if the next interview is with that person. 

Ask if there is anything you should know about him or her that will make your integration a smoother process. This will help you as you begin, and if you take diligent notes, the helpful pointers given will only aid you in those first few weeks.

#### A Word of Caution
Asking this question can be kind of tricky. You will want to avoid giving off the impression of a gossip, or someone that is seeking personal, insider information. Avoid that at all cost. 

Instead, lightly ask if there is anything specific that will help you as you begin. Ask openly, and try to avoid any sort of conspiratorial tone. 

This question should not be about workroom chatter. Instead, it should be something that will give you a leg up in the first few weeks on the job. 

#### Follow-Up Questions
You could ask a few follow-up questions. These could include anything like asking about specific tasks that arenâ€™t necessarily on your employee expectations list, or events that you will be expected to attend that are not on the calendar. 

Having an open line of communication, in which you can ask honest, important questions is necessary. If this is a question that you do not feel comfortable asking, or if the answer makes you feel uneasy, then you should take this into consideration when it comes time to accept the position.
