Now that you know from the previous chapter how you will be evaluated and what the expectations for your role are, it’s time to understand better the people with whom you will be working.

Chapter 6 focuses on questions that allow you to understand the people and overall culture of the company. This is an area that is much more of an art than science, but the quest is well worth the effort.

Whichever industry or company you end up working with. And whether it is a local or a global organization, you will always be working with other people. These people will always create some type of working culture.

Even if it sounds fluffy to you, I’d still say that some of these questions might help you build rapport and get insights in other areas.

The list below is rather extensive – pick the ones you like most and have more in the back of your mind.
