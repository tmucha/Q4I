### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT ASKING QUESTIONS IN A JOB INTERVIEW
#### HOW MANY QUESTIONS SHOULD I HAVE?
There is no one magic number. Still, it is a good idea to have at least four or five really solid questions. Odds are that at least some of them will be covered already earlier in the interview. You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you had only one real question to ask. Or worse, that the topic was already fully discussed and you have nothing to say at the end of the interview.

#### DO I NEED A QUESTION FROM EACH TOPIC THAT IS LISTED HERE?
Absolutely not. It's up to your own preference. Some of the topics might not be as relevant for you or the job that you are applying for. Keep it relevant and real.

In any case, it's probably good to have some questions that can always be used at the end of the interview. Questions about next steps in the recruitment process are well suited here <span class="contents-link" onclick="window.location.href ='/questions-to-ask-interviewer/chapter-7'">see chapter 7</span>. Also, questions that directly ask if the interviewers have any reservations about you are good for closing (see questions <span class="contents-link" onclick="window.location.href ='/questions-to-ask-interviewer/chapter-4#article27'">#27</span> and <span class="contents-link" onclick="window.location.href ='/questions-to-ask-interviewer/chapter-4#article29'">#29</span>).

#### HOW MANY QUESTIONS SHOULD I ASK?
Again, there is no perfect number here. I'd rather recommend asking more than less. It shows your interest. It helps you to understand the company and the job better. And it shows that you can take initiative. Of course, these need to be relevant questions and not just some random ones.

Follow your intuition about how the conversation is going and ask all the questions you feel you'd like to hear answers to.

In general, personally I'd expect at least 5-10 questions from a job candidate during an hour-long interview.

#### WHEN SHOULD I ASK MY QUESTIONS?
Also here, there are no hard rules here, but in most cases the interviewer invites you to ask questions at the end of the interview. Still, in many cases the job interview is, or at least can be, a two-way conversation. Therefore, you can ask questions as you come across a relevant reason to do so.

From my experience as a job applicant and, later as an interviewer, the best interviews include several questions from the applicant throughout the interview and not just at the end.
