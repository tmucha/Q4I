Throughout your interview, you will have learned what the role you are applying for is. You will have been provided a job description (either brief or well-detailed) and the interviewer may have given you a task listing for the position.

Yet, to be a successful employee is to know what lies ahead for you with the position. Learning what your employerâ€™s expectations are of you for that first year will provide you a better understanding of what is required and if you are able to face that challenge.

Having these details from the onset will help you decide if you have the skills to carry out the role for the next year.

#### Why is this important to ask?
This is your opportunity to reiterate to your interviewer that you are committed to the position and are genuinely interested in knowing what their anticipations are for the new employee.

You will also show that you are willing to aim for targets that are put in place and will be held responsible for those outcomes.

When you ask what will be expected of the employee for the year to come, you are requiring the interviewer to put into words what the demands will be. Sometimes they may not have thought that far ahead and your question may cause them to take time to think about their answer.

Let them have their moments to prepare. The information they give you will be very valuable in your decision making.

If they do not have the details at that time, it is acceptable to ask them to forward you the details following the interview. If they offer you the position, you will want to know what their expectations will be for you for the next 12 months and can prepare to either accept their job offer or decline it.
