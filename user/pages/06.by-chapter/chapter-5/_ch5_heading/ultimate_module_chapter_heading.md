The previous chapter revealed questions that help you get the job, by making sure you communicate your strengths and ability to meet the requirements to enter into the new role.

Once you do start the work, you are no longer evaluated based on the requirements, but rather based on the expectations for your role. Welcome to the world of perceptions and expectations.

This chapter focuses on questions that help you uncover these expectations.

The questions listed here are very practical and, so to say, very much down to business. Asking some of these questions profiles you as a success-focused professional.
