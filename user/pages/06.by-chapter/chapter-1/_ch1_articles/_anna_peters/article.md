### Anna Peters
#### Why job candidates should ask questions in a job interview?
Any job candidate who does not ask any questions during their interview is red flagged. Period. Just as you would in building a friendship, asking good questions shows interest and genuine curiosity. If you end the interview saying, "No, I think I'm good," your interviewer will understand that you're just not interested in their opening, and probably end the relationship. 

If you really want the job, you should feel some curiosity about what it's like to work there, who you'd work with most, how they describe their organizational culture, how they would measure your success, and what kind of skills would complement their team.
