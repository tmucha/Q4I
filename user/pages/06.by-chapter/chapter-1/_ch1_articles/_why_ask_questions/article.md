### Easy way to fail an interview... and how to avoid it

Most jobseekers, when thinking about an interview, primarily focus on how they can answer all the questions that will be thrown their way. This consumes so much of their attention that asking their own questions at an interview is nearly forgotten.

This should not be the case! An interview is a two-way street. An interviewer expects that you will ask some questions and will often remember you more because of the questions that you ask, rather than because of the answers that you give.

Think for a moment about an extreme case of a job candidate not having any questions at all. What would you think about such a person, if you were the interviewer? He or she would probably appear lazy, unmotivated, and unprepared. This is exactly the opposite of someone you would want to hire as a manager.

You don’t want to appear like that unprepared applicant yourself. On the contrary, you want the future employer to see you in the best possible light.

### Three reasons why you must ask questions in an interview

There are three primary reasons why you must ask questions in your job interview:

1. Questions allow you to verify if the interviewer has any reservations about you. Consequently, you can remedy any concerns and leave the room with everyone feeling that you are a perfect candidate.
2. Your participation through questions breathes life into the conversation and demonstrates that you are truly interested in the job and the company.
3. Answers that you get allow you to make the decision if this is the place where you want to work. After all, you are interviewing your potential future employer as much as they are interviewing you.

There are thousands of possible questions that you can ask an interviewer. No matter which questions you decide to choose in the end, they should be in line with at least one of these three primary objectives listed above.

The following six chapters guide you through six different types of questions that you could ask in an interview. They all help you find if there is anything else you should explain or demonstrate to the interviewer, show your interest and make sure the company is right for you.

The next six chapters give you ideas for questions about:
* Job
* Company
* Requirements
* Expectations
* People and culture
* Next steps in the hiring process

But, before we go there – if you’re still not convinced with what I’m saying about asking questions in an interview, I’ve got something special for you.
