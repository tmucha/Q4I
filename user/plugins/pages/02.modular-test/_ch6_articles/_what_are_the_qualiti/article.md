During your interview process, you will have the opportunity to ask several questions that are well-researched and specific to the company. 

Whether you are interviewing for a management position or not, you should definitely ask what the qualities of a successful manager are. The qualities or traits given in the interviewer’s answer will only help you in your eventual success.

If you are interviewing for a management position, you will want knowledge of the skills and core competencies the company treasures in a leader. If excellent people skills and multitasking top the list, emphasize how you have demonstrated those traits throughout your career so far.

If the interviewer lists other key skills, ensure that you can match those. Be prepared with specific situations that show off how you have used them in the past to benefit your previous employer.

If you are not interviewing for a management role, you will still get a wide view of what they deem important. This will help you when you begin your new position. It will also help you work towards advancement.

#### The Interviewer’s Response
You may get a response along these lines: The best managers in our organization are independent thinkers, are good teachers and completely aligned with the direction in which the company is headed. 

Be sure to key into the list he or she is giving you. Take good notes, and reference them throughout your first few weeks on the job. This is a direct route to potential success, and you should not waste it.

If he or she cannot name a single star in the managerial stable, that is problematic and may indicate the organization is short on progress or promotions. This could be a definite bonus for you, and could imply rapid movement within the company.

This should also give you pause. If they are short on top down leadership, you should consider why. Follow-up questions could be about managerial training, or even if there have been multiple transitions within the company in the past year.

Always remember that you are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you, and that you are, without a doubt, the best person for the job.
