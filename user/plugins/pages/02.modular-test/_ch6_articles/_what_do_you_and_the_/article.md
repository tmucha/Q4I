One of the best parts of a new job is learning about all of the people you are working with. Forming friendships builds camaraderie and loyalty within the job. 

It is important to feel as though you are part of a team, and to also get along with those around you. One way to build this rapport is spending time together during downtime. This is easy to do at lunch.

#### The Importance of Casual Questioning
When you prepare for an interview, you should always create a list of questions. Create one list of important questions that must be answered before you leave the building, and create another list of questions that you can ask casually. 

You can ask these casual questions while you are on the tour, while you are meeting with other team members, or while you are waiting to transition to another part of the interview.

These casual questions are helpful because they give you the lay of the land. They help you figure out workplace culture and how employees interact with each other.

They will help you gain insight into how daily operations at the company run, and how you will eventually fit in.

#### The Interviewer’s Response 
Asking what employees regularly do for lunch is definitely a more casual question. However, the answer can give you real insight into the company morale. 

If employees regularly just do working lunches at their desk, pause and consider this.

If employees like to go out together for lunch, consider this, as well.

If there is a workroom for employees to lunch together, ask to see it if it was not already on your tour.

While it may seem like their response is easy going and carries little weight, think again. 

You should always be considering company culture throughout your interview. Consider both sides of the spectrum. 

Casual questioning will give you an insider look at how things operate from day to day, but it will also give you valuable information about the company’s temperament.
