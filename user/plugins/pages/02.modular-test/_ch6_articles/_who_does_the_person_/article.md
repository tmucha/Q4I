When you are applying for a position, it is likely that your application is directed to someone in Human Resources. It is also likely that this person will be doing the interviews. This is a typical practice for many larger companies at the first interview.

If this is the case, you should definitely ask your interviewer who you will report to when you start. This is a very informative question, so make sure you ask before you leave. 

#### Reporting to Your Boss
If someone from Human Resources interviews you, do not worry - you will still get the opportunity to meet your eventual boss. This will likely happen during the tour. 

When you meet them, lead with a firm handshake and introduce yourself. If you are allowed time to ask him or her questions, make sure that they are efficient, and well-researched.

However, at the end of the interview, when you have an opportunity to ask a few well-rehearsed questions, make sure you ask who you report to.

This is important because you might be applying to a position that has multiple managers, or multiple people that fill out performance evaluations. 

You will want to be very clear who you report to, and who will eventually evaluate you. If you have two bosses, it is certainly okay to clarify which one will be doing the evaluating. If it is both, itâ€™s important to know that going into the role.

#### After You Ask
After you ask about who you report to, take special note as to what your interviewer says. Make sure you take notes, and ask any important follow-up questions as needed. 

If he or she can supply specific names, write those names down. After your interview, search the company directory or LinkedIn for these managers, and note the specific departments they work for. Any additional information that you can collect prior to your next interview or start on the job is just icing on the cake.
