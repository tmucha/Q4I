After you have scheduled your interview, you should immediately begin work on researching the company, if you haven't started yet. This work should include some of the people you will spend your days with.

When you go into the interview, you should have a relatively clear idea as to who you will work for, and in what department. 

However, asking about the team you will spend the most time with every day is very important. You are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you. 

You need to know if you will enjoy working there every day just as much as they need to know if you are the best fit for them.

#### Why Ask About the Team
At the end of your interview, when it is time to ask your researched questions, make sure to ask about your team. Because these are the people you will spend the majority of your hours with, it is important to get a generalized feel as to how they operate.

You will want to know if they are driven, if they have any quirks, or if they are just newly formed. You will want to know about their challenges, and how they come up with solutions. 

It is in your best interest to gain as much information during your time with the interviewer as possible. Pump that person as much as they will let you, and store all of the necessary tidbits in the back of your mind.

You will be working with these people, so it is important to pay attention to the honest in the response you get. 

#### During the Tour and at the Company’s Facilities
If, by lucky chance, you get a tour, pay very close attention. Watch to see how you will fit into the group, and how your skills will complement theirs.

Be sure to bring this to your interviewer’s attention, as well. Paint yourself as one of the actual team members already, and ensure they know how well you match the team in place.

Once they see how well you will mold into the group, it will be hard for them to choose anyone but you.
