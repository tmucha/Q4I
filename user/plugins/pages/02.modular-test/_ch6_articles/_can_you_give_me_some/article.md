When you are interviewing, it is important to remember that the company should be selling themselves to you, as well. Not only are you interviewing for them, but they should be interviewing for you. 

You want to make sure that the company or business is the right fit for you, and the interview is about the only time you will get to make sure this is the case. 

At the end of the interview, when it is time for you to ask some questions, take this thought into consideration. What could you ask that will give you a wide view of the company’s culture, and how the day-to-day operations go? 

#### Aspects of Company Culture
Whether your direct supervisor is interviewing you, or just a person from Human Resources, make sure you ask what the most and least desirable aspects of the company culture are. Even if you do not get a straight answer, this question is still important.

You want to know all parts of the job, not just what you are required to do every day. Knowing how the company runs every day, and how the employees act is important, as well. 

#### The Interviewer’s Response
Asking this question could go one of two ways. 

They could give you a fluffy answer in which everything seems perfect. This might just be completely honest, as well. Take it at face value and move on. 

Or, they could give you a startlingly honest account of what life is like inside the business. Take this at face value, as well. 

If they are honest and negative, add this to your pro and con list when the interview is finished. Despite the negativity that they impart, could you still envision yourself working there every day? 

And if they are honest and positive, take this into consideration, too. Definitely add their points to your consideration list, and think about how it impacts your daily life at your new job.
