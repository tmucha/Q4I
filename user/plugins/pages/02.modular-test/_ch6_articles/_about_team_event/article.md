When you are preparing for an interview, pay special attention to the job description. Will you be working individually? Or will you be working with a team?

When it comes time to prepare your researched questions for the end of the interview, take this into account. If you will be working with a team, ask questions that are team oriented. 

#### The Last Team Event
Depending on the company you are applying to, asking about the team’s last event might be a good idea. This will show you a couple of things: 

You will find out if they produce large scale events (and what kind of work that takes), or if they prefer smaller, more intimate settings. 

Also, you will figure out just what kind of role you will play in these events. 

#### Other Questions
Once you ask about the team’s last event, there will probably be follow-up questions. Do not be afraid to seek clarification if at any point you become confused.

Ask a few of the following: 
* Are these events required? 
* Are these events scheduled regularly? 
* How you determine who is in charge of the events? 
* What made the events successful? What would you change? 

#### The Interviewer’s Response
If the last event your team organized was an office birthday party, or if there really aren’t office events, then obviously your follow-up questions won’t be necessary. 

It is completely possible, too, that your interviewer may just not know about your team events. If you are interviewing with someone from Human Resources, that person might not have their finger on the pulse of your new office. Here, too, follow-up questions would be unnecessary.

However, if you do get a clear answer as to what events your team plans, then take diligent notes. When it comes time for your office to do another event later on down the road, you will be able to reference these notes and possibly play a key role.
