In this day and age, company growth is a big deal. The company you are applying to should be not only willing to show you their rate of growth, but also prepared to show you their expectations for the future.

When it is your turn to ask the questions at the end of the interview, do not waste time.  Take this time you are given and use it in the best possible way.

Ask big questions and take notes over the given answers. One question that definitely needs to be asked is how the department will change in the coming months.

#### Additional Department Personnel
If you are applying to a new company or one that is just up and running, it is almost an expectation that new employees will be added to the workforce. Asking for clarification as to those numbers is still a good idea.

This is an important question because it will tell you subtly about the office workflow. Will there be interruptions for personnel training? Will it become a revolving door with the company?

If the answer to these questions is yes, then you should really take into consideration what you really feel. If you feel like you can work in circumstances such as these, then by all means, accept the position when offered.

If the answer to these questions is a resounding no, then you should withdraw from the process and move on.

#### Their Final Answer
The truth of the matter is that they just may not know. If they cannot give you a firm answer, then you are going to have to be accepting.

They may also want to see how much work you can handle when they bring you on before charging ahead and hiring more employees. This is also something to take into consideration before formally accepting the position.
