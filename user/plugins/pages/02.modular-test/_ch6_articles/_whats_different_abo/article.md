You have been asked many questions about yourself and your work experience. Now, you have the chance to ask your interviewer about their personal experiences.

People enjoy talking about themselves and your interviewer will be able to relay some of their experiences working for other companies and how it compares to the one they are currently working.

You will get first hand details about the best parts of working with this company. Knowing what motivates another employee that you may be working closely with, will give you a great way to measure what you may also like about working there, if given the opportunity.

#### Is it appropriate to ask the Interviewer this question?
As mentioned, people like the opportunity to talk about themselves, and this would be no exception.

Speaking to your interviewer about their previous work history and experiences can create a sense of fellowship and solidarity between two people interested in working for the same company.

You may also enter into a conversation about working with previous employers and why you also think you may be best fit to work with this same company.

You will have started a good rapport with the interviewer and this will be a great way to stay on top of their mind when they are reviewing the candidates. They may remember that wonderful conversation and how well they got along with you!

Having the interviewer talk about themselves will make them feel pleased with interview, pleased that you were interested in asking about them (which may not happen often during an interview), and pleased that you may have more interest in working for a good company, instead of just focusing on the paycheck.

Most likely, the answer you receive from the interviewer will be a positive one.

If they struggle to provide you positive elements of why they are working for their current company, or seem very negative in their answers, keep those details in mind. You will want to ensure that if you are offered a position, this will be a place you would like to come to every day.
