This question starts delving into the inner workings of the company and its sectors.

By asking about how the company runs, it is showing the interviewer that you are interested in more than just getting the job. You are also wanting to know exactly what the processes are.

It is advantageous to understand how the department you would like to work for operates alongside others.

Understanding the systems, procedures and operations of the departments and company will better prepare you for the role, if you are the successful candidate.

#### What can I take away from this question?
Have you ever started a job and realized that you didn’t know what your responsibilities were, who you were to work with, or exactly how the company was run?

By asking the above question, you can help alleviate that anxiety of the “unknown”.

The interviewer will be able to provide you more details than would be available in a brief job description.

They will have more explanations of how your department would function, and how they would work together with other parts of the company.

You may learn that the department you are applying for works independently of other departments. In this case, you may be working closely with one team who has sole responsibilities.

Or, perhaps the department works with several different divisions within the company. If this is the way the company is structured, you could be working with many different people and should adjust your working style to blend with different personalities.

You will learn a lot about the company, the department you are applying for and what will be expected of you if you take the position.

If you are offered and accept the job, you will start your first day of work informed and knowledgeable about what lays ahead!
