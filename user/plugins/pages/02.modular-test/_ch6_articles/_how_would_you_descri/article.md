Certain professions lend themselves to either collaborative work, or independent work. Chances are, depending on your chosen career field, you are aware as to which column you will likely fall under. 

However, sometimes businesses like to shake things up. Clarifying how your team operates is never a bad thing. 

#### Asking About Work Environment
The work environment that you will be a part of will be on display when you take your tour. Take special note as to how everyone is working. Does there seem to be a collaborative spirit in the air? Are people talking together in groups, working in conference rooms, or partnered up in cubicles? Or, are they sectioned off, and quietly working independently? 

Take note as you walk around as what it feels most like to you. Take this information back with you as you continue your interview. This will help you formulate a work environment question that is very important. 

You should ask how people like to work in the office, and if it ever changes. Are there both collaborative and independent work times? And when and how does that happen? 

Work environment also covers how people generally act. Are employees competitive with one another? Are they helpful and engaging? Do they seek to challenge each other and better their teamâ€™s product? 

All of these follow-up questions are crucial, as they will help you get a better feel for the workplace. Remember that you are interviewing them, as well. You should be trying to figure out how you best fit into the space, and if that space is right for you.

#### Why This Question Is Important
Getting a solid feel for the company or team that you are going to work with is imperative. If they work collaboratively, your new ideas for the team should center on how to get the projects finished efficiently and in a group atmosphere. 

If they work independently, your ideas should focus on how you can complete your work effectively and surpass the standard set forth.
