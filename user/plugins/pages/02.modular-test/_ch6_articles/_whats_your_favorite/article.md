Once you have made it past the initial application process and into the interview rounds, you are one step closer to a new job. 

Prior to your interview, ensure that you have a wealth of well-researched questions at hand for when it is time for you to ask at the end. These are important questions that will help you gauge if the company is the right fit for you, and will help you other information not previously covered in the interview process.

However, some of these questions might be casual and rapport building with your interviewer. These are almost just as important.

#### Office Traditions
Asking your interviewer about their favorite office tradition is a good ice-breaker. This is a casual question that could be thrown out during a transition period - like to your tour, or to fill out additional paperwork.

This question will incite some kind of conversation or friendly banter. This will show that you are approachable, and good natured. These are definitely pluses on your candidate profile.

Office traditions can be anything from food drives, to Christmas parties and Secret Santas, to happy hours on Friday afternoons. Whatever your interviewer answers with, act interested, and ask any necessary follow-up questions.

#### Tradition Haters
If your interviewer suggests that there are no office traditions, that they do not celebrate anything, or that the staff rarely (if ever) get together after work, perhaps take this into consideration as well.

You spend so much time with your team - at least eight hours a day. They will become your work family, and traditions add a little something extra and shiny to your workday. 

If there are not any, take note. Does that sort of atmosphere fit in with your personality? If it does, then good. If it does not, then really think long and hard if you would be a good fit for the position. 

Remember, if there are not traditions, you can always start one when you begin your job.
