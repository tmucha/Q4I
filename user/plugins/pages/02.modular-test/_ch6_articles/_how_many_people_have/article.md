This is an important question, and you will need to listen carefully to the answer. How the interviewer responds will give insight into the job, the management and the culture of the workplace.

Is there a high turnover rate? Why did the employees leave? Were they fired or did they resign?

You will hope that the interviewer provides details and examples of why previous employees left the position/company so you will not need to continue to press for more answers.

#### What are the good and bad signs?
The best sign of a great employer is that there is a low turnover rate. A term you may also hear is attrition, which refers to the number of people who will have resigned or left their position on their own.

If there is low attrition you may take this as evidence that the company provides a healthy work environment, has positive employees and management and is generally a good place to work.

You may learn, however, that there have been some employees that left. You will need to examine this information based on the type of position you are applying for and the type of company it is.

If you are applying for a position that is only held by a small number of people and there has been a high attrition rate, that could be an indicator of problems within the company. There may be an issue with the position, the demands, the management or the team itself.

High turnover rates will not always necessarily be a result of a poorly run company. Certain industries have been known to have a “revolving door” of employees based on the nature of the job.

Call centers, retail, technology and consulting companies generally have higher attrition rates compared to other industries. There is a host of reasons why this is; the age of new hires, using the position as stepping stone to higher paying jobs, or high stress levels.

What you will need to learn is if the company fires their employees or if the employees resign, and why this happens. Why would the employees be terminated, or why would they quit? And will you be able to work for this company knowing this information.
