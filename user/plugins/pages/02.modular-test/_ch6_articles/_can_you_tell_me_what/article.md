Your interview could last an hours, and maybe even longer. The person you are interviewing with and you will hopefully build a rapport, and you might even feel comfortable enough to ask a few casual questions.

If this is the case, you could ask what they love most about working at the company to which you are applying.

#### Why Ask About What They Love?
This is information you need to know! The last thing you want to do is to work somewhere where you are miserable. A good way to get a feel for that is to ask the hiring manager what it is that keeps them coming in day after day.

If you ask this question while you are on your tour, or maybe before you transfer to someone else for a different part of the interview process, you might catch them off guard. This is probably the best time, as you will probably get the most honest response.

#### The Interviewer’s Response
Hopefully, your interviewer will answer with an abundance of positive things. With any luck, they will love coming to work every day, and they will be happy to tell you all about it.

If this is the case, make a mental note and take a few notes down about what you remember at a later time.

If your interviewer’s response is not positive, simply nod and smile. Do not encourage further negativity, and move on with another question.

However, you should definitely consider his or her response. If it was negative, weigh the information. Will their answer impact your daily life? Do they just have a negative outlook on life in general, or were their concerns relevant? 

At the close of the interview, take into account all that you have seen during the day. Do not let this particular question and answer sway your decision making. While loving what you do every day is definitely important, keep in mind that this was just one person’s view. 

Take that for what it is worth.
