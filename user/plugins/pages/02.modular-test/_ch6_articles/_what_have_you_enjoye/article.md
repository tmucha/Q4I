When you get to the interview process, remember that you are sizing up the company just as much as they are sizing up you.

Take into consideration the person interviewing you. Do they seem happy? Do they seem slighted? Do they seem like they are just going through every day motions, or do they genuinely seem to enjoy what they are doing?

#### During Your Interview
During your interview, you will get an opportunity to ask a few questions. Make sure these questions are well-researched, specific to the company that you are interviewing with, and related to the job you are applying for.

One question that you could ask your interviewer is what they enjoy most about working at the company. 

Even if the person interviewing you is just part of Human Resources, or not even remotely related to your eventual team - this is still a good question.

The given answer will give you unique insight into how satisfied people are with their jobs there. If the interviewer is pained to come up with an answer to your question, consider this to be a big red flag. 

However, if they can toss out three or four things they really enjoy, also take note. 

#### An Important Note
It is important to remember to take the answers of opinion questions such as this with a grain of salt. Each employee could come up with a different answer depending on their experience, or even depending on what kind of day they are having. 

You also might be asking an employee that is on their way out the door. So, your decision as to whether or not you join the company should not hinge on this one answer. Just take the answer for what it is worth, and hopefully, you will have gained some valuable first-hand knowledge as to how the company works.
