Welcome to the first chapter of my Ultimate Guide to Asking Questions in a Job Interview.

In this section, you're going to learn why it is so critically important for you to prepare your own list of questions for the job interview and ask them, when the right time comes.

This is not any set of rules that, if you follow them, you will be able to trick or instantly impress the interviewer. Instead, the underlying motivation is related to truly preparing you better for the interview and making you a better candidate.

At the same time, having the right questions to ask during an interview will help you find the job and company that is in line with what you will appreciate in the longer run.

After reading this section you will have the right foundation to find the questions that you need to ask in your interview. The remaining chapters will give you lots of ideas.
