Your interviewer will most definitely ask you what your strengths and weaknesses are as an employee. This is a vital time for you to be honest and open, but also to show off your talents.

Just as they ask you what your weaknesses are, you need to ask them what challenges you will face. It is a mirroring question to theirs, and one that they should very well be prepared to answer.

#### The Challenge
You are likely the type of person to take challenges head on. They are much easier to face, however, when they are clear and when you know they are coming. Starting your new job with the challenges already in mind will be crucial in the first couple of months.

Knowing what is ahead of you will help you formulate some sort of starting point. It will guide you as you plan your work, and serve as a compass for direction. Stay true to that compass, and when the time comes, you will be prepared for the challenges they’ve alerted you to.

#### What You Face
It is completely possible that you are taking on a role with hardly any challenges at all. It is more likely, however, that you’re taking something on with a long list of work ahead of you. Any interviewer worth their salt will be honest with you in this regard. It will make an obvious difference in your decision.

Let the list of challenges that you face sink in. Really meditate over where you are at in your life and career. Are you prepared to take on all that they are asking of you? If you are not, then it is definitely time to evaluate your stance on your application to their company. If you are, this might be the company that will launch your career to a new level.
