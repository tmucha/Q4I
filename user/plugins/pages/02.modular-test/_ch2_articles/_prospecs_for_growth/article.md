A well-placed question at the end of an interview can make or break a candidate.

A specific question can also show the potential employer that you mean business and that you are serious about doing well in the position for which you are applying.

Whatever questions you decide to ask (and you should definitely ask a few!), be prepared to take notes. Throughout the first few weeks in your new role, reference these notes often. They will be your road map for ensured success.

#### Why This Question is a MUST Ask
Asking your interviewer how you can grow in their company, and how you can move up the ranks is a must. Do not leave your interview without tossing out this gem.

This question tells the potential employer that you are dedicated to the long haul and will be a faithful servant to their business.

Once you ask, you will also gain valuable insight into how to work towards a successful progression through the company ranks.

#### An Important Answer
Hopefully, your potential employer will give you a good overview of how your position could change and grow throughout your tenure with them. Hopefully, they have a solid business model in places that allows employees to better themselves, and to help in new ways.

If they do, they will have zero problems in allowing you to see how you can advance.

You need to take a hard look at continuing your candidacy if they do not have a growth plan in place for employees.

If the job you are applying for is as far as you can go in the company, would you still accept the offered position? And if you answer yes to that question, then you should have a plan in place to move on once you learn what you need to know.
