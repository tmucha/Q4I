When you spot an ad in the newspaper or online that you are ready to apply for, the real work begins. Submitting your resume and cover letter are the easy parts.

Interviewing is the tough part. Preparation will help.

Compile a sturdy list of questions for the end of the answer. And as you interview, make a mental note of things that need to be clarified. It is an expectation of you to ask questions, so never feel like you are taking up too much time or that you are inconveniencing someone.

#### Sometimes a Tricky Question
If ever there was a tricky question in the interview process, this question would be it.

Asking why the position is open or if you are replacing someone is a question that requires finesse, especially if the job you are applying for is not part of a graduate scheme where rotation is expected. Tread lightly and be mindful of potential minefields (like an employee death or illness).

Itâ€™s definitely a plus if this position was recently created and you are the first to fill it. Much more often, however, you will be replacing someone.

If it is the case that you are a replacement and you are not given any further details, you should probably leave it at that. Do not continue to press for a specific reason for the previous employee leaving. This is easily information that can be gleaned when you begin your work with the company.

#### Big Answers
It is completely possible that your interviewer will be cagey in their answer, or evasive. Take note immediately if this is the case. A lot of times, confidentiality plays a role in the exit of an employee.

Staying true to this confidentiality is a mark of character, but it also tells you to press no farther in your line of questioning.

Also take note of a straight answer. This, too, is a good sign. It gives the distinct impression of having an open line of communication and transparency.
