The way the above question is phrased is beneficial in several ways.

First, you will be able to find out what the daily/weekly hours are for the position. Is the regular work week 40 hours, or is it expected to be more or less?

Second, you will learn if there is overtime. As an employee, you may want the option to have overtime hours. If you prefer a standard work week, you may rather not be in a job where overtime is an expectation.

And finally, by asking what are the hours worked by successful employees, and if they accept overtime, you are giving the interviewer a positive impression of your work ethic. You are suggesting you could work the hours needed in order to be successful. You are also indicating that, if the company accepts it, you may be willing to put in the overtime as needed.

#### Should I ask this question in the interview?
Yes, it is most of the time suitable for this question to be put forth to the interviewer. This will be the best way to ensure that the hours they expect you to work and the overtime that may (or may not) be needed coincides with what you are willing to offer.

A common mistake is to change the phrasing to “What are the hours for this position”. You do not want to come across as someone who is only wanting to work the bare minimum hours required. This may not be your intention, but the interviewer may perceive it that way.

Be sure to ask your question in a positive manner with the intention that you are a hard worker who would be prepared to put in the hours.

If you feel uncomfortable asking about working hours during the interview process, you may wait until you are offered the position to start asking about those specifics.
