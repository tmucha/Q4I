Assuming you are applying for a job that was advertised, you have read the description. The job ad text typically attempts to give you an overview of what the job responsibilities are and what are the requirements or expectations.

However, you have to bear in mind that the job ad is still an advertisement. Its purpose is to attract as many qualified applicants as possible. Therefore, it might focus on the best aspects of the job and not expose some of the downsides.

Most of the time, there is no intentional hiding of the information, but rather a "selling perspective". After all, companies are also competing to hire the best talent.

#### Further benefits of the question
Another aspect of this questions is that it opens the discussion to other points that are relevant from the viewpoint of the recruiting manager, but that were not mentioned in the job ad.

This is important, because the job ad often is used as a first draft or the script for the interview.

Therefore, unconsciously some interviewers might stick only to the points that were mentioned in the advert and forget about some other relevant items.

Finally, this question gives an opportunity for the recruiter to make a description of the job and some of its aspects with her own words. In this sense, it can be more detailed and give hints on different aspects of the work, such as team cooperation, culture or expectations.

#### How to approach this question if there was no job ad
If the job was not advertised and you were able to get the interview thanks to networking or cold calling, this question can be slightly modified to match your specific situation.

In any case, it is likely that someone has already given you some information about the job. You can use this information as an anchor and in this way ask for more. Also, you can spin it and start with your own vision of what the work might include and ask for feedback on that.
