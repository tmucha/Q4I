Applying for new jobs is an exciting time. The idea of facing new challenges and meeting new people can be fun.

Once you make it through the initial resume and cover letter writing hurdle, you’ll be called in for an interview. This can be a painless process, if you commit to doing your homework.

At the end of your interview, be prepared to ask as many questions as possible. You’ll want to leave the interview fully clear on expectations, rules, and procedures for the position.

#### Travel Time
If it has not already been made clear via the ad you are responding to or throughout the interview, then you definitely should ask about travel time.

Travel time directly impacts personal lives, and often not just your own. If you have a family, or are just starting out in life, travel time requires a period of adaption. If travel is required, you should be prepared for such before even taking the position on.

When you ask about travel time, be prepared to ask important follow-up questions.

Who will pay for your meals, and what does that process look like? Who will pay for hotel accommodations, and who is responsible for making those reservations? Is there further compensation for travel (i.e., do you get to keep your hotel points, rental car points, etc.)?

Also, you should be aware of how often you will be gone. Is it a weekly traveling gig? Monthly? Yearly? Clear that up before you exit the interview.

#### Interesting Circumstances
If this is a new position, your interviewer might not have a clear-cut answer for you.  If they are still formulating your new duties, they might have to get back to you.

Assure them that this is okay and that you understand. However, before you formally accept the position, be sure you are completely aware of your eventual requirements. Do not sign on if they are still unsure.
