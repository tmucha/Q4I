Towards the end of your interview process, the interviewer may ask you if you have any lingering questions. This is a basic opportunity to turn the tables a little, to have the interviewer sell their company to you.

Remember - you are not someone that will take just any work that is offered. You can be selective about which company you choose, and rightfully so.

This will also add another layer to your overall image. Asking important questions will show them that you are organized and prepared, which is a definite impression you want to make.

#### Why THIS Question?

Asking a future employer what their plans are for the job or position that you are applying for is important.

Not only is this a pretty plain signal that you are planning to stick around for the long haul, but it also shows that you are willing and ready for growth opportunities.

It shows them that your eyes are on the horizon, and that you are already thinking ahead. Asking this question shows the interviewer you plan on having longevity with the company and want to better understand the position you are applying for.

You will also gain insight into your potential future as their employee.

Is this a long-term position, or is it a contract with a specific timeline of work? Is this a job where you see yourself over the next several years? Is there room for growth, or will you hit a roadblock in your career?

These are all important aspects you will need to think about if you are offered the position.

If you are applying for an entry level position, or even for a job at a new company, this question is a good place to start. It shows your employer that you will be dedicated and that you are ready to work hard for potential advancement.

Everyone likes a go-getter, so show them through this well placed question that you are one.

#### Their Response Is Key

How they answer this particular question speaks volumes about the company.

The interviewer should be able to provide details of the future direction of the position. If they are unable to do so, you can request them to forward you the information.

If your interviewer is at a loss, it could just mean that they have not prepared well. However, it could also mean that their business plan is a mess, or that they are planning on your position being much more temporary than you initially thought.

Either way, tread lightly if your question does not receive the solid, affirming answer that it deserves.

Ideally, they would respond in a collaborative manner, and a conversation would start. You could lend some insightful ideas about where you would like the position to go, and they will be impressed about your research.

Your thoughts on where the particular position is headed might just be the determining factor between you and the next candidate, so make sure that you have prepared well, and that you present your ideas logically, concisely, and convincingly.
