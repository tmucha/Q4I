Having an expectation of either consistency or change in this position will set you up for success.

It is important to give yourself an expectation of a position so that you know what your measure of success will be. Typically, a job description will give that to you, but you can never be sure of any underlying issues. A job interview is the place to find these out before you accept an offer.

#### If They Answer “No”
If the person says a simple “No”, then you can always ask them to elaborate on the responsibilities listed. Take careful note before going into an interview on any of the duties you may have questions on.

Most job descriptions include something along the lines of “Other duties as required”. It is helpful to understand that you might get some additional work outside of what your job description states.

What you would like to know is if the top priorities of a position plan on staying the same for the foreseeable future.

#### If They Answer “Yes”
If the person says “Yes” or “Maybe”, think about the details surrounding the job.

Is the department new? Have the other employees been recently hired? Sometimes in a new situation or something similar, the responsibilities may change in keeping up with the organization and it is valuable to know that.

This will be where you can ask them how and why they expect the responsibilities to change.

Remind them that you are comfortable and excited for change, but that you need to know what to expect and how to adapt.

You also want to know that there will be a place for this position in the next six months to a year. 

After listening to their answer, think about if it makes sense to you and if it is in line with your personal career goals.

Even though you are the one vying for this position, the company is trying to impress you as well. You have a lot to offer and you only want to gain experience in what excites you and launches your career!
