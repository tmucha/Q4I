While it may sound “negative”, this is a terrific question to ask.

You have already asked about the positive aspects of the job, but asking about the difficult facets of the position indicates to the interviewer that you are seriously thinking about joining the company.

This will be information that is not in your job description and is not a common question asked by many interviewees.

You also show that you understand the job will have its own obstacles that will need to be overcome. 

Through this question, you will have gained information that will make you well-prepared to handle the challenges that come with this position.

#### How do I use this information?
The interviewer should be able to provide some instances where there will be demanding times ahead, whether it is during Quarterly Reviews, tax season, month end reports, or perhaps every Friday afternoon!

It will be how you use this information that sets you apart from your competition.
You can use these “negatives” and turn them into a “positive” by selling yourself and your skills.

When the interviewer gives details about the tough times that would be in store for the newly hired, you can relate that back to a similar difficult time you had during school or at a previous job.  

You can then take the opportunity to share how you overcame that obstacle and turned a stressful time into a learning experience.

Through this question you also let the interviewer know that there will be instances that you may not be able to complete your task or will need assistance in order to be successful. It is not a sign of weakness, but rather a strength in knowing what the obstacle will be and how you will find your way to conquer it.

What you learn should help you understand the more challenging aspects of the position and if it is something you will be willing to take on.
