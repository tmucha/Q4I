There comes a point in every interview when they ask you if you have any questions left. You should definitely come prepared with intelligent, researched questions that fit the company to which you are applying.

This question and answer time is reserved for you to make final impressions on the interviewer. Do not leave them wanting. Be ready to make one last stand. Show them how much they need to hire you.

#### Evolution of a Position
Intelligent questions beget intelligent answers. Asking about the evolution of a position should spur on an interesting and important conversation that will shed light on a number of different things.

First of all, you will get to see how the company has progressed over the course of the time the position has been around. Has the company grown? Have they remained stagnate? Be sure to consider this information carefully. And if you are unclear, follow up questions are always allowed.

Secondly, you will get firsthand information as to how the actual position has grown. Is it a position that has ever-changing norms? Or, is it a position that will always require the same thing? Pause and reflect on the answers given because this is how you will be spending your days with the company.

Finally, the answer will reveal potential. Is there potential for you to grow as an employee? Any room for upward mobility? As you gain your footing with the business, you are going to want room to expand your talents. Does this position allow for headway?

#### Precise Answers
Be wary if you do not get a clear answer. Covering up the fact that advancement or expansion within the position may not be possible is a shady practice. Heavily consider your reaction. Do you want to be involved with such a company?

If you get a straight answer, then make a notation. Add it to your long term “to-do” list, and prepare yourself to start immediately.
