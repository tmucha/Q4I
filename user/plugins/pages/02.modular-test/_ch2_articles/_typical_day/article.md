Throughout your interview, you may get lucky and get a tour of the company. Be particularly observant of the employees and how they are interacting with one another. Are they diligent in their work? Are they standing around talking? Does there seem to be an urgency in the office?

All of these questions compound into one really big one: what does a typical day in the office look like? Hopefully, your typical day will be the same throughout your first year on the job. With any luck, they will give you adequate time to really learn, grow, and mold your talents into the jobâ€™s requirements. This is a crucial time period for you as an employee, so it behooves you to really clarify their expectations.

#### Why It Is a Big Deal
Asking what a day or month looks like in the office is important for a couple of reasons. First, it will give you a good look as to what your office life will be like every day. Also, it will give you an idea as to how the office life changes throughout the course of a year.

By asking this question, you should gain a pretty good overview of the pace of the office, the type of work the office handles, and the general satisfaction of the employees.

Of course, this will lead you into asking more questions. The interviewer is there to help you gain insight into the company just as much as they are there to gain insight on you as an employee. Really utilize this time, and ask until you are clear of the expectations.

#### With the Answer
When your interviewer answers this question, it will be your job to decide what to do with the information. Do you like what you hear? Can you visualize yourself in that space every day, doing what they are asking you to do? If so, it looks like you are in the right place. If not, then it is certainly time to evaluate what your next step will be.
