When you get a tour of the company, if you get it during the interview process, take special notice of the team you will be working with. Do you notice anything in particular? It will be a quick walk through, so you may not be able to glean any important information from the surface.

When you are casually observing, take note as to how the employees are working. Together? Separate? Mostly at their computers? This will help you get an overall feel for the work environment, but it will also help you phrase an important question later on.

#### Asking About Polish
When it is your time to ask a few questions at the end of the interview, you should be well prepared already. Whatever you observed during your tour will come in handy here.

Ask the interviewer where the team could use some polish. Ask how you could help better the team, or in what areas they are the weakest. 

This is an excellent question because it will allow you to gracefully engage with the interviewer. You should be able to slide in a strong trait that you have that will help in their weakest area. 

This simple negative turned positive will impress your interviewer, and any time you can add another strength to their growing list is a definite win.

#### Listening to Their Response
When you ask the question about where the team needs the most polish, you need to make sure you listen to the response. Take notes if you need to. 

Reference these notes going into the job after you are hired. Come up with some ways to help easily and efficiently. 

This is a quick and simple way for you to get your foot in the door with your team. They will immediately view you as a team player and someone that enjoys a challenge. And it is all due to the fact that you asked a simple question during your interview.
