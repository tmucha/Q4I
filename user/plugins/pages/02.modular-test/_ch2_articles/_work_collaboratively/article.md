There are not enough words to tell you how important it is for a company to encourage collaborative work. Besides productivity, it boosts office morale, decision-making, innovation, and many other, positive attributes a company wants.

No matter what the position you are interviewing for is, there should be opportunities for you to collaborate with others.

#### Face-to-face Time and Remote Collaboration
Face-to-face time is a simple way for companies to encourage collaboration. There are many ways this happens. Working in an open, inviting space and having a break room or something similar are just a couple of examples.

Face-to-face time is not always possible in an organization. In a situation like this, you would want a company that has the appropriate technology, so that people can stay in touch and communicate.

You will want to know if the executive person hosts team and interdepartmental meetings. Meetings like these are important for employees to know what other people on their team are working on and, even better, where the success and focus for other departments has been. Whether these are formal or informal does not matter, just as long as people are getting together!

An alternative to traditional meetings are collaboration platforms that make use of internet and smartphones. Young and innovative companies tend to be more open to such solutions, while large and traditional companies often stick to the old-school approach.

Information shared at meetings or via collaboration platforms is beneficial to you because you can learn more about the company and if there are opportunities to help one another reach a goal.

#### Collaborating Doesn’t Have to Be All Work
While this isn’t necessarily something to ask directly (although not completely frowned upon!), listen for someone to talk about team outings, corporate activities, or just general socializing. This can give you an idea of the atmosphere within the walls of the organization.

The benefit to outings and socializing is people don’t feel as threatened or bogged down by the daily grind. It opens the doors to co-workers having more light-hearted conversation and to think outside of the box. 

The point is, you want to know whether and how you work encourages developing relationships, fostering your growth, and is dedicated to your success.
