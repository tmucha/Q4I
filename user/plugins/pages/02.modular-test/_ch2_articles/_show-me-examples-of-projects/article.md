One of the greatest advantages that you have as a new applicant is your zest for the company that, perhaps, experienced lack of employees. 

Your new blood also comes with a set of new ideas and skills. This is one of the best parts of hiring new employees. As you move throughout the interview process, keep that secret in your back pocket. 

#### Asking the Project Question
When you tour your potential new workplace or simply discuss about the team and the company, try to take a peek at what the employees are actually engaged in. File all of the information in the back of your mind and ready yourself to ask about it at the end of the interview. 

Because of your diligent research pre-interview, you should have some idea as to what the day to day life is like at the company. You should know something about what they are working on, or have some broad idea as to what they do. 

When you ask about what projects current employees are working on, be sure to lead with something you’ve researched. 

It could be something like the following: 
* “I noticed in the news that you have been working on …” 
* “I saw recently that you won a contract for …”
* “When I was researching your company, I noticed that you do a lot of work for …” 

When you ask, be sure to put what you have researched or already know at the front of your question. This will show your interviewer that you have clearly done your homework. 

#### A Short Answer
There is a possibility that whatever the company or business is currently in progress on is a secret. Or maybe, they just are in the habit of not talking about work with non-employees. 

Be prepared for your interviewer to give you a somewhat vague answer. If this is the case, take them at face value and move on with other prepared questions. 

However, if they do give you a detailed answer, be sure to take detailed notes. Reference these notes after the interview, and research any key points. 

You will want to be prepared to hit the ground running when you are hired, and this will help you to do so.
