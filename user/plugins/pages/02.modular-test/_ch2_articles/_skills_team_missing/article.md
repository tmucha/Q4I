Before you begin the application process, take a skills test at your local employment center or online. This should give you an excellent idea as to what skills you possess, and it will help narrow down business or companies that will be a good fit for you.

It is important to remember that your skills differ from the person coming in to interview behind you. They set you apart. They will also be the determining factor in whether or not you get hired. 

#### Before the Interview
Before you interview with the company, take another look at the requirements they listed for the job. 

Match your skills up with what they were looking for, and then think of a couple of situations in which you used those key skills. This will be helpful and potentially very important during the interview.

#### During the Interview
When it is your turn to ask the questions, definitely ask your interviewer what skills the team seems to be lacking. This is important because it will help you narrow down how you can help the team, but it will also show the person interviewing you that you are a team player, and you come ready to help.

Be sure to list those key skills that you researched before the interview, and toss out the situations in which you used them. 

Prepare to show strengths and skills off, and phrase them in a manner that suggests you can help: 
* “I’m really good with Microsoft Excel, perhaps that would be a good fit for this particular area …” 
* “I’ve been trained with Adobe PhotoShop, and you mentioned that’s something you were looking for …” 
* “I’m awesome when it comes to sales. I can show you my previous numbers, if you’d like, and I know I can help the team in this area …” 

Remember: never lie. When your interviewer gives you a list of skills that the team is lacking, never comment that you are comfortable doing something that you clearly are not. Not only is this dishonest, but it puts you in a poor position for hiring.
