When you are applying for a new job with a new company, you will find it best practice to know exactly what that companyâ€™s plans for the future are.

If the company has plans to continue to grow, this should in turn, give you the opportunity to grow with the company. This would be an important piece of information, if you intend on staying with the company for an extended length of time rather than using it as a stepping stone for a job elsewhere.

You can also use this information to see, if the company is a right fit for you.

If you want to develop with a company but the company vision is to stay tried and true without having any real plans for growth and improvement, it may not be in your best interest to take the position, if offered.

Your interviewer may also be impressed that you are showing interest in the company, not just the position you are applying for. Expressing your interest in the industry and future growth will suggest to the interviewer that you are willing to help bring the company success for the long term.

#### What answer should I expect?
If you ask this question to your interviewer, you may end up receiving a variety of answers. It will depend on how knowledgeable the interviewer is of the company and of its future plans.

Some points that could be brought up are the financial goals of the company, additional staff hires for growing departments, national or international expansion or other plans that are unique to the industry that you are applying for.

You may not fully understand the scope of the growth the interviewer is providing to you at the time, but you will likely gather some details that you can use for your decision, if you are offered the position.
