The subject of this question is very important. Performance reports and reviews will influence your future with the company and will be a factor in your advancement.

You will want to know how your performance will be assessed and the processes for that procedure. It will give you some knowledge of how the company manages their employees and if they respect and value their staff.

#### Why should I ask this during the interview?

It would be advisable to ask this questions during the interview.  Knowing this information will give you a good idea as to how the company treats its employees.

If they have a performance review structure in place they most likely have a system that assists their employees and provides support when needed.

Asking these questions also shows the interviewer that you understand performance review structure, are familiar with having your work and abilities evaluated and are prepared to accept feedback that will help you become a successful employee.

This question will also give you a clear breakdown of how the actual performance review works. Not every company and organization is the same and each has their own method. If you are offered the position, knowing how you will be measured and evaluated will guide you to do your best work.

If the company does not have a performance review procedure in place this may give indication that the support for employees is minimal. It may also signal that employees are not overly managed and are required to be successful without too much intervention.

If you prefer to work independent of structure and the formality of reviews, this may be a great place for you to work. However, if you would rather have the evaluations of your work, and know that you would need it to be productive, you may need to decide if this would be the best work environment for you.
