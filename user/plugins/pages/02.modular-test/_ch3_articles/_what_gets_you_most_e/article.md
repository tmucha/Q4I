This is a wonderful way to learn what your interviewer thinks of the company they work for.

They can give you great insight about the company, how the management works with their teams, future goals and what it is like to work there. It would be a benefit to know these details before you are offered a position.

You are asking this question to learn about some of the objectives of the company, but to also see if the employees (such as your interviewer) are excited by their company and what the future holds.

If your interviewer is engaged and enthusiastic about the future of the company, you may be too! This could be a great indication of a positive work place with creative people willing to work hard and make the company successful.

#### How will this help me?
People generally like to speak about themselves, and interviewers are no different. By asking the interviewer their thoughts, you are engaging them to talk about their experiences and expectations.

You will be able to see if you and the interviewer share the same drive and interests, which may indicate if you would fit in well with the company.

Your interviewer should be able to provide you with a wealth of information about the goals of the team, the departments, and the company as a whole. And they should be excited when sharing them with you.

If they are unable to think of an answer, or struggle to provide one, you can take this as an indication that either the interviewer is not keenly interested in the future of the company or the topic of the company’s goals are not regularly discussed.

You will want to make note of the way the interviewer answers the questions, the range of their answers and if the answers motivate you as well.
