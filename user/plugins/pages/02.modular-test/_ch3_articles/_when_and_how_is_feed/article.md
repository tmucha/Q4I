Throughout your interview, you will speak about a myriad of things. One of those things will probably be how employees are evaluated. Hopefully, you come away from the conversation clear about company expectations. 

However, there is a big difference between evaluating and normal feedback. Feedback can be anything from a “good job” to “this area over here needs some work.” It could just be a response in an email, or it could be a verbalized expectation. 

#### Asking About Feedback
In your interview, it is important to differentiate between feedback and evaluating. Once you are clear on evaluation, go ahead and ask about feedback. Definitely ask these questions when time is given to you at the end of your interview. 

These questions might resemble something like the following: 
* “Is feedback given in written form most of the time?” 
* “How can I expect general feedback on projects?” 
* “What does constructive criticism look like here?” 

#### A Quick Note
This question should not make or break your decision as to whether or not you accept the job. Constructive feedback is different for everyone. 

If you have a specific style that works best for you (written, verbal, praise, criticism), make sure your new boss is aware. If you respond better to a certain type, ensure that you are on the same page with your team. This will only help you be more successful in the long run.

#### The Interviewer’s Response
Take note - there might not be a formal way that feedback is given. Your interviewer may not have any idea as to how managers at the company approach this area. 

Also, there may not be a specific timeline for feedback. You, as an employee, might just have to be okay with this. 

However, if it is something that truly does bother you, make sure you are direct with your superior. Chances are, they will be glad to give you pointers.
