When you are walking into an interview, the biggest weapon you can take is preparedness. Directly after receiving an invitation to interview, you should begin the company research process.

This process is much more advanced than it was when you were merely looking for places to apply. This research should include internet research, but also word of mouth and news articles.

Part of this research should include competitors. The reason is twofold: you want to be able to identify salient points in beating the company competitor, and maybe, since you are still in the application process, a top competitor could be a place to also apply.

#### During the Interview
When you are finally asked if you have any questions at the very end of your interview process, one of your questions definitely needs to be about the top competitors. 

This is where your research will come in handy. If you already know the details about who the companyâ€™s top competitors are, then you should be able to identify them by name. It will impress your interviewer, for sure, but you should then also be able to discuss in-depth challenges that the company interviewing you faces.

The interviewer probably will not hand out company secrets or even company strategy. However, if you have identified some quality solutions, this is an excellent time to bring those forward. 

You want to present to your future employer that you are up for the challenge. Presenting yourself as well researched and dedicated to company conundrums will probably put you at the top of the candidate pack. 

That is where you always want to be. 

#### On the Other Hand
If you did your homework and you failed to come up with company competitors, it is okay. You can most definitely ask during the interview process. 

It could be that you have applied to a new company, or to a company that currently holds some kind of monopoly in the market. If this is the case, asking the question is completely beneficial. 

Hopefully, the interviewer is up-front and honest. As always, be sure to take detailed notes when they answer. This will definitely be helpful as you begin your new position.
