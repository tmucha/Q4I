Knowing the direction and goals of the company is important. Understanding how the company plans to meet those goals is essential to being a productive company, team, and employee.

When you ask the above question to the interviewer, you are showing that you are interested in the direction of the company.

But when you go further to ask how the team can help the company achieve their target, you set yourself apart from the other candidates.

You will be highlighting your team work skills to your interviewer, while also learning exactly what the team will be doing to make the company successful.

#### How are the goals important?
Companies have most likely spent a lot of time and energy establishing their goals. Much research would have been conducted to decide which targets would need to be hit and when they need to be reached.

They will have also determined which departments and teams would be responsible for the various facets that would ensure achieving the goals set out.

Knowing these goals is important for the team to identify their direction and how they are going to get there. Without having these goals and targets, employees and teams have difficulties to know if they are on the path to success.

Different areas of the company will have their own roles to play, and all are vital for hitting the established targets. When each employee, team and manager knows their role, they all work together to achieve the same result - reaching the goal.

When the interviewer has answered your question, you will want to take away with you some of the following information. Are the goals of the company attainable? Is the role of the team able to help achieve those goals? Do you think you could be part of this team?
