As an interview candidate, make sure you are researching the companies that you are applying diligently. When you walk into the interview, you should be completely knowledgeable about where you applied and their business practices.

They will ask you a wide array of questions, and it is only fair that you get to respond in kind. You can certainly ask questions at any point in time during the interview, but most of the questions are saved until the end. Asking where the company is headed in the next few years is a perfect place to start.

This is information that is probably easily found on the Internet or through various publications. It is not hard to figure out stock prices, or profit margins. What is not as simple to figure out, however, is the company vision.

#### Company Growth
Having a goal in mind for a company is a big deal. If there is an end point in mind, employees have something to unify them, something to work towards. Applying to a company that knows where they are headed is incredibly important.

You will want to work for a company that has a clear vision for the future. You will want to work where they have a definite next step in mind.

If you ask this particular question and the answer given is wishy-washy, or a muddled mess camouflaging an “I don’t really know”, then it is time to reassess your application process. Can you work for a company that doesn’t know where they are headed? Place value upon your own gut feelings.

#### Finding the Importance
This question is not one to take lightly. The given answer will help you as you move forward. Whatever vision your potential place of employment may have will become your own vision.

This is where you will gain your own checklist for accomplishment. Listen carefully to the answer, as it will be beneficial for you when you begin working.
