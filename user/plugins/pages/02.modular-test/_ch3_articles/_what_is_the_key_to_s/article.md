When going into an interview you will need to remember that although you are hoping to impress the interviewer, they are also trying to impress you! Asking the interviewer questions about the company and how it works is a great way to see if you’re a good match.

When asked how an employee can be successful, you give the interviewer a great impression of a hard worker who is willing to thrive in the business.

In turn, they are going to tell you the ways that current employees have made their mark and will give you advice on how you can do the same. This is a wonderful tool to becoming a quality employee who will have future growth with the company. 

#### What should I be looking for?
Depending on the type of organization, you may be provided a host of different qualities that make a successful employee. Some terms you may hear, “team player”, “leader” and “great communicator” are just a few qualities that make a successful employee.

The interviewer may also provide achievement milestones and measurements to evaluate the success of the employee. This may be done through a bonus structure, awards, promotions and other similar methods.

You could be provided with examples of employees who did not succeed, and this can be a guideline of what you should not do if you are hired. Negative qualities can be useful to hear, but should not be the primary focus of the interviewer.

The response of the interviewer will give you a good understanding of what the expectations will be if you are hired for the position. You may realize that the requirements to be successful do not coincide with your work ethic. Or, you may find that this company will be the perfect fit for you.

By asking how to be successful, you will be on your way to finding that perfect job.
