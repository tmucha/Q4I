Throughout the course of your interview, asking questions is mandatory. Your future employer will expect them. Chances are, they will feel a little confused if you choose to not exercise your right to ask a few things.

Asking how many new employees have joined the force throughout the past year is something that can easily be squeezed into conversation. Maybe you ask on your office tour. Maybe you decide to wait until the end. Regardless of when you ask, you need to make sure this question stays on your list.

#### Why Hiring Rates Are Important
This is a serious question. If employee turnover rates at your prospective place of employment are high, then perhaps it is time to reassess your application process. If they are constantly replacing employees then you need to determine the why. Is it stressful? Is it a difficult work environment?

If the turnover is low and employees are staying on a long time, then it should be obvious to you that a pleasant work experience will await you.

Also, it is important to realize that employees can be added due to company growth. This is, obviously, a good thing, and should be seen as such. Company growth equates to more business opportunity for you. That is always a bonus.

#### Following Up
However, your interviewer answers this particular question will set your course for follow-up. It will be easy to determine whether or not they are fudging the truth or evading any difficult to present facts. It will be your job throughout the course of the interview to weed out the truth.

Remember, you are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you. They should prove to you that this is the where you belong. If you donâ€™t like the answer you are given, or if the information presented is still unclear, then ask again. You are always allowed to ask for clarification.
