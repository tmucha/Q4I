This is a great question to ask to get a better understanding of the company – information you may not find on their website or news articles.
 
It also demonstrates your interest in the organization by delving deeper into the inner workings of your potential employer.

Don’t be nervous about asking this question. You will want to hear what the interviewer has to say. They will have firsthand knowledge about the company and can give you details that you never would have known if you didn’t ask.

#### How is this question relevant/important?
With an open-ended question, such as this, the interviewer will be able to provide an answer that can be quite varied and unique. The interviewer can share with you as much (or as little) as they like.

Some of the responses you receive may be more about the job itself. For example; how different departments interact, how management structure is set up or if there is a mentorship program. This will give you further material to help in deciding if this job is best for you.

The interviewer may also share aspects about the culture of the company.  Perhaps there are potlucks at the end of each month, casual dress Fridays, or they are heavily involved in charity projects and encourage employees to participate.

Knowing the culture of the company will be significant to your enjoyment at work. If you are performance driven and do not enjoy work events, then you may not choose to work in an environment that prides itself on its casual atmosphere.

On the other hand, if you enjoy the social aspect of work, that company may be your best fit.

You will be able to garner some interesting facts during this discovery process. If you are fortunate to have multiple job offers, you may end up using the information here to help you make the final decision of who your new employer will be!
