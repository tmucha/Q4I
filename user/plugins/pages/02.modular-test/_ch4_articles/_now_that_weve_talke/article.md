At the end of the interview, you will be given space to ask a few thoughtful questions. Use this time wisely, and ensure that you are asking company specific, intelligent questions.

One question you should ask is about any final concerns.

#### Throughout the Interview
During the interview, you should be selling yourself. Try to get in as many job specific positive traits in as possible. Show yourself off. This is not the time to be humble. You want the job, so show them why you deserve it.

At every turn, show your interviewer why you would be perfect for the job, team, and business. Do not leave any doubt in their minds as to why you are the best choice. 

#### At the End of the Interview
When it is your turn to ask questions, openly ask if they have any concerns about you, or how you would perform in the position.

This can be a tricky question, and you need to prepare yourself for possible blunt honesty in the answer. 

Now that your interviewer knows all of your qualifications (because you sold yourself so well), asking if they have any concerns will give you another chance to tie things up. 

#### The Interviewer’s Answer
This is a very important part. Whatever the interviewer comes back with, you should have a solid reason as to why this should not be a concern. You need to have a prepared rebuttal for each of their concerns. 

Hopefully, they will not have any concerns about your eventual success. If they do, you need to make a strong case for yourself. Show them how you could do well. 

If the interviewer fails to come up with any concerns, then you have done a remarkable job. Still take this opportunity to reiterate a few of your key skills. Politely thank your interviewer, and tell them that you are looking forward to putting your strengths to use. 

This will end a resounding campaign with you, hopefully, as their top choice.
