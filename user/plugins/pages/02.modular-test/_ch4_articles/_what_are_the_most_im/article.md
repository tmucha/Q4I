Whether you are making a career change, you are just graduating from college, or if you even just want something new every day, you have honed an excellent skill set. 

Putting those refined skills to use at a company that appreciates them will increase your productivity and will help you to feel more useful and valued. 

#### Before You Apply
Before you even apply, make sure you have completely read through the application requirements. If they require a degree you do not have, experience that you have not earned, or training you have never received, really think about submitting your application.

Weigh the pros and cons. Is the training, education, or experience necessary for the position? Is it something that you can do on your own time before you begin working? 

You can always submit an application even if your skills do not match the requirements. You might get lucky and get an interview, or you might not. Regardless, you have still gained valuable practice, which is always worth something. 

#### When You Interview
If you get called for an interview, you should begin research immediately. Think about the training and the skills needed. Evaluate how your own skills and talents match up, and be prepared to sell yourself.

Throughout your interview, you will probably be given a tour. Take special note as to what projects people are working on, how they are working on them, and who is in charge. 

When it comes time to sit down at the end of the process and ask your prepared questions, one question on your list should be about required skills.

When you were on your tour, did you see anyone working on specific technology? Did you see anyone using instruments, or tools, that you may not have experience with? All of these things are skills, and you need to know if they are required or not.

The interviewer may give you a specific list. Pick two or three things off of the list and candidly talk about how capable you are. Definitely relate specific situations back to those two or three skills. 

Remember, this is your time to shine. Really show them what you know and how good you can be. It will be the difference in landing the job â€¦ or not.
