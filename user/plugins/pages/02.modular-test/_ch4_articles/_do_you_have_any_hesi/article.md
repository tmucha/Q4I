This is a strong question to end the interview with. It shows you are self-assured and willing to hear any critiques that the interviewer may have.

A great employee is one that can accept advice and direction. Being open to change and improvement is one of the most important characteristics an employee looks for in a candidate.

If you can show great confidence during the interview, this is confidence that may translate well in the work environment.

Being optimistic in your questioning and confident in your answers will leave the interviewer with a positive impression!

#### How do I respond if the Interviewer has concerns?
A great way to prepare for this is to review your resume. Take note of any points that may cause concerns during the interview. Are there gaps in your work history? Do you lack formal education? Are there certain technologies that you are not familiar with?

After analyzing what may give the interviewer hesitations, prepare reasons of why and how these hesitations can be overcome.

Explain why there were times you were not employed. Describe how your work experience and training is equivalent to formal education. Show how you can quickly learn new technology and systems.

Utilize this to your advantage. If the interviewer has hesitations, they should explain what those are and how they think they would impact your success in the position.

The concerns that are brought up could also help you decide if this position is right for you.  If there are worries about your qualifications or about your abilities to keep up with the job, you may also come to the realization that this position is not right for you at this time.

It is always important to keep an open mind when interviewing for a job. Answer the questions with thought and honesty, and you will find the position that is right for you.
