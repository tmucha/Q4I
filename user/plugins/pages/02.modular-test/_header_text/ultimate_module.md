## Introduction
### Why did I write this guide?

I wanted to give you the most extensive and detailed guide to Asking Questions in a Job Interview that exists today. This resource is piled to the top with ideas for questions related to the job, company, requirements, expectations, people and culture, as well as, the remaining steps in the interview process. All of the questions can be taken immediately into use or modified to meet the requirements of your specific situation.

I’ve included everything from why to ask questions in an interview to what questions to ask and how. All of this is so that you have all the information you need to all really stand out in an interview and be insanely successful— all in one place!

### Who is this guide for?

If you’re a student or a recent grad and are just starting to look for the first jobs that will be in your professional career, even if you still have a rather blurry idea about which company to apply to, this Ultimate Guide to Asking Questions in a Job Interview is for you.

### How much of this guide should you read?

To get the most value, you’ll want to read the whole thing! While you will not ask every sing question from each section in your job interview, you will gain an understanding of important concepts in each part.

The difference between getting and not getting the job you want can be as simple as asking just one good question. So ask at least one question in your next interview, even if it’s only half an hour from now. If you have more time, prepare even more questions, and have them ready in your sleeve, so that they flow smoothly at the interview.

To start, you may read whatever section appears most relevant to you now, but it can definitely benefit you to read it all.
