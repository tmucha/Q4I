This question will put a focus on your abilities and how you can assist the company with challenges they face.

The interviewer will see that you are thinking about how you can contribute as a team player, and they can imagine you being successful in that role.

Every position and company faces problems and challenges, so your interviewer will more than likely have at least one problem that needs to be addressed.

If your interviewer states that there are no issues the staff encounter, the interviewer is not being honest with their answer or is not knowledgeable about the department.

#### How can I use this information?
This question is two-fold. On one hand, you are highlighting your attributes to the interviewer and indicating that you would be able to help the team conquer the problems that they encounter.

You will also be garnering important information from the interviewer.

You are going to learn about difficulties that are facing the team, department and/or company. It will be beneficial to ask yourself if the position would be right for you.

Will these obstacles be something you can overcome? Do you think you will be able to assist the team with the challenges they are coming up against? Do you have the experience?

Ask yourself these three questions and it should help you determine your suitability for the job.

You will want to ensure the position is something that you can handle. If you are up to the challenge, now is the time to tell your interviewer what you will be able to do for the company.

If you come across as a problem-solver who is interested is doing what is best for the team and the company, the interviewer will keep that in mind when selecting the successful candidate for the position.
