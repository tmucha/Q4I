Being a new kid on the block can be difficult. Learning a new role in a new business or company can be even more difficult. Coming into the company will be a new process and learning how the day-to-day operations are handled will be tricky.

Throughout the interview process, it should be important to you to figure out what will be expected of you during those first few weeks and months on the job. You will really need to get a feel for what the expectations will be as you learn the rigors of your new profession.

#### Why You Should Think It Is Important
Asking your interviewer what they will expect from you during your first few months on the job is a big deal. Will you be evaluated in your new position? If so, how frequently? What will be the measuring tool? These are all important follow up questions that could potentially sway your choice.

Asking this question is also important because it will give you a measuring stick for performance. You can use this answer to help guide you as you begin working. Likely, they will give you a list of important checkpoints. Use these as you get to work. Really pay attention to what is being asked of you.

#### When They Answer
Often, interviews are conducted by someone in Human Resources. You need to be aware they may just not know the answer. You need to also prepare yourself for a potentially vague answer. If this is the case, you will just have to move forward. You could ask for an email address of a current employee in a similar position, but you might just be pushing your luck.

If they do respond with a solid answer, then respect what they have to say. It’s valuable and it will help you enormously when you get the job. Be sure to add this to your interview notes so that you’ll have a gauge for those first few weeks on the job.
