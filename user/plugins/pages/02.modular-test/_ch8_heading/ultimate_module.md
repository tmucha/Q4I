Now you already have all the tools in your Questions for Interviewer toolbox. Or… do you?

This final chapter gives you the missing piece – the “How to” and the “Dos and Don’ts”.

Please, don’t take these as strong rules, but rather guidelines. Some points here are very practical and can be easily put into practice (like avoiding multi-part questions), while others might be more of an individual opinion.

They all aim at helping you feel more comfortable as you ask questions during a job interview. Like the whole guide, feel free to take whatever feels right for you.

Ready. Aim. Fire.
