### FIRST THINGS FIRST
First of all, use your brain and common sense. No two companies are alike and no two interviews are exactly the same. Not to mention that you are a unique person and you have to follow your own intuition.

Now that we have the first point covered, we can move on to more actionable advice. Still, keeping the first point in mind.

### GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR ASKING QUESTIONS IN A JOB INTERVIEW
It is important to prepare questions ahead of time. While it is normal that you might come up with some good questions on the fly, it is not enough to leave it all to chance.

Questions are part of your preparation for the interview. They not only help you shine as the best candidate for the job, but also enable you to interview the employer. Validating that the company and position is a good fit for you is as much of a job for the interviewer as it is for you.

Asking well thought out questions is the most straight forward and efficient way to dig into the company culture and the specifics of the day-to-day responsibilities on the job. Consequently, the questions help you get the job and have as smooth of a start as possible.

While most of the questions listed in the chapters above can be taken directly into use in your interview, it is perfectly fine to come up with your own questions. You can use those listed on this website as an inspiration.

In any case, it is important that you really think how the specific questions apply to the company, job and your profile. Therefore, you might want to tweak, expand or modify the questions listed here. Below you can find some further guidelines for asking good questions.

Ask one question at a time
Avoid multi-part questions that require very complex answers. Each question should have one specific point, otherwise you will overwhelm the employer.

It is much better to say that you have several questions and ask only one at a time.

Avoid questions focused on yourself
"Me" questions are those that put yourself ahead of the employer.

This type of questions includes topics such as salary, health insurance, vacation time, work hours per week, and other concessions. During an interview, you are first and foremost trying to demonstrate to the employer how you can benefit the company, not the other way around. Once they come back to you with a job offer, you can begin to ask what the company can do for you.

Ask questions on variety of topics
Avoid asking questions about just one single subject. If you do, this subject with stand out unnaturally and draw the interviewer’s attention.

For example, if you only ask questions about the team and their collaboration style, the interviewer might assume you have an issue with team work.

Ask questions about a variety of topics to demonstrate your curiosity and interest in all aspects of the job and company.

Avoid "Yes" or "No" Questions
Remember that interview is supposed to be a dialogue. Most “yes” or “no” questions are not conducive to real conversation.

Furthermore, questions that require only such a short answer are likely to be answered by searching other sources, such as the company’s website. Thus, asking this type of questions might indicate you haven’t done proper research before the interview.

Avoid personal questions
Avoid overly personal questions about the interviewer's family, race, gender, etc.

While it is definitely a good idea to try to establish a rapport with your interviewer, it is better not to ask personal questions that are not public information. For example, if you see a college banner on the employer's wall, you can certainly ask if he went to that college. 

#### Questions NOT to Ask at a Job Interview

There are some questions that you should avoid asking, since they won't present you in a positive light.

Can I do this job from home?
If this is a telecommuting job, the job description would have said so. Asking to work from home implies that you dislike working with others, you do not work well under direct supervision, or you have a difficult schedule to work around. Occasionally, employees who have held a position for a long period are allowed to telecommute, but this is not a concession you should ask for on a first interview.

What does your company do?
Avoid asking any questions about the company that you could have researched beforehand on the company website.

These questions demonstrate that you have not done your research, and imply that you are not interested in the position.

When can I take time off for vacation?
Do not discuss previous commitments before being offered a position. Asking about time off before getting a job offer implies that you are not going to be a fully committed employee.

Did I get the job?
This question puts employers on the spot and makes you appear impatient. Instead, you could ask for more information on the next step in the hiring process. For example, you can ask, "Do you generally do multiple rounds of interviews with job candidates?" However, if they are interested in you, most employers will give you this information before the end of the interview.

What is the salary for this position?
Do not ask this question on a first interview. If you know that you will refuse a job that pays less than a certain amount, you can state the amount in your cover letter. However, if you are even somewhat flexible regarding salary, it is best not to discuss compensation until you are offered a position.

How many hours will I be expected to work each work? Will I need to work on weekends?
Questions about hours and extra work imply that you are hoping to work as little as possible. A better question would be, "What is a typical workday like?" The answer will likely give you insight into expected work hours.

How long would I have to wait to get promoted?
This question implies that you are not interested in the position for which you are applying, and that you are merely waiting to move on to something better.

Instead, you could ask the employer, "What are some of the opportunities for growth at this company?"

What type of health insurance does this company offer?
Wait until you are offered the position before you begin asking questions about benefits. However, if there is a benefit that you require from a job (such as a particular type of health insurance, a daycare program, etc.), bring it up with human resources rather than the interviewer.

### OTHER FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT ASKING QUESTIONS IN A JOB INTERVIEW
#### HOW MANY QUESTIONS SHOULD I HAVE?
There is no one magic number. Still, it is a good idea to have at least four or five really solid questions. Odds are that at least some of them might be covered already earlier in the interview, thus you don't want to find yourself in the situation where you had only one real question, which was already discussed.

#### DO I NEED A QUESTION FROM EACH TOPIC THAT IS LISTED HERE?
Absolutely not. It's up to your own preference. Some of the topics might not be as relevant for you or the job that you are applying for doesn't justify asking some of the questions. Keep it relevant and real.

#### WHEN SHOULD I ASK MY QUESTIONS?
Again, there are no hard rules here, but in most cases the interviewer invites you to ask questions at the end of the interview. Still, in many cases the job interview is, or at least can be, a two-way conversation, thus you can ask questions as you come across a relevant reason to do so.
