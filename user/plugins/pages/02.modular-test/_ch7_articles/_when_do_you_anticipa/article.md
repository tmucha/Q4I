There is a myriad of reasons for applying for a new job. Maybe you are unhappy with your current position, you have just graduated college, or you could even be making a career change. Whatever your reasons, applying for new jobs can be tricky and interviewing can be scary.

When you decide it is time to look for a new job, be sure to ask plenty of questions. You are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you.

Regardless of your current situation, you will need to start working in the position fairly quickly. Asking when the company will expect you to work will clear up any ambiguity, and will help you set your personal calendar.

#### The Question and Answer
Hopefully, your interview will run smoothly and feel like a conversation. If you are to the end of your process and they still have not answered when you would potentially start work, then you definitely need to ask before you leave.

They will want to work with you on how to proceed. Do you need to give your two weeksâ€™ notice to a current employer? Can you start immediately? These are important things to hash out.

It should be noted that many companies do require a two-week notice before you leave. Staying true to that rule will help you leave in good standing, and will probably ensure a needed reference down the line.

Starting work immediately should be done under careful consideration. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time in order to process what is being asked of you.

Look at your notes when you exit the interview and formulate some sort of plan of attack. How will you operate during those first few weeks on the job? Once you have that figured out, getting to work should be a breeze.

If they have a firm start date, be sure to respect that. They are, after all, the ones that will be potentially be cutting your paycheck.
