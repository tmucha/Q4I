Once your interview is over, you do not want to leave the room wondering when you will hear from the company, or how you will hear from them.

Generally, you would like to know what comes next. A simple “We’ll be in touch” doesn’t necessarily mean they will reach out to you after the interview nor does it tell you how you can expect to be contacted.

#### Before You Leave the Interview Room
Before you leave, find out the timeline for the position. By asking how the hiring committee will get in touch with you, it opens the door to them telling you a general timeline of when they will reach out. This will also give you an opportunity to check in with them, if the end of the timeline has been reached and you still have not heard from anyone.

Having all of the correct contact information is important for both parties.

#### Remember to Be within the Reach
Make sure you are available by their means of contact. You will also now know where to look for contact from them.

Sometimes your email inbox will put unknown sender emails in a separate folder. Remember to look in other folders within your inbox as well.

How someone will get in touch with you shows you how that person prefers to be contacted. If you find yourself in a position where you needed to reach out to that person, you will know if you should email, call, text, etc.

Double check that they have your correct email address and phone number as well as you have theirs. You can always ask for someone’s business card to ensure you have their information.

You will also want to know if they will get in touch with both successful and unsuccessful candidates. Even if you are not offered the position, you will still want to hear from someone. Remain positive and ask them to keep you in mind, if another position were to open up within the organization.

Last, it always helps to send thank you notes immediately after an interview. Keep track of who you spoke with and their position so that you know where to send their note. Having this conversation, along with sending a thoughtful note, will make you stand out among the other candidates.
