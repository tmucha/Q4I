The application and interview process are the hard parts. Sitting through a lengthy interview in which you are trying to sell yourself at every turn is exhausting. 

Until you begin the waiting process. 

#### The Interview
During the interview, you likely had the opportunity to speak with your potential new boss, and you probably had a tour. You even had the opportunity to ask a few questions at the end.

You should have asked how you will eventually hear of a hire, and who you should stay in contact with until then.

After you leave the interview, the waiting game begins. It can be intense and nerve-wracking. You might have to come back for another interview, or you might even have questions that you did not think to ask during the interview.

This is why asking for a contact is extremely important.

Before you leave your seat, make sure you ask your interviewer the name, phone number, and email address of a follow-up contact.

Also, be sure to ask how long you should wait to hear. 

You could phrase this question in a myriad of ways, but always make sure you do it positively. These questions can be asked in the following way: 
* “How soon can I expect a decision?”
* “Will there be a follow-up interview?”
* “How will I know that you have decided?”

You could be the first interviewee, or you could be the last. The timeline will likely vary, and they may not even have it nailed down yet. 

Patience is key. 

#### Post Interview Follow-Up
When you are given the name and contact information for whom you should follow-up with, do so sparingly. Remember, they are busy, and you do not want to seem like a pest.

A couple of days after your interview, write a thank you note to the person that you interviewed with. Tell them you enjoyed your experience, and thank them for giving you their time.

And then, you wait. 

If you have not heard anything and it has been at least ten business days, go ahead and follow-up. Compose a well written email, and politely ask how the process is going. As always, if you get hired by another company while waiting, it is always good practice to let everyone you interviewed with know to withdraw your name from consideration.
