You have done your resume, applied for the position, and completed the interview. It is natural to want to know what the next steps will be.

It would be suitable for you to ask this question during the interview process and is generally recommended to do so. It is preferable to ask during this time rather than calling at a later date inquiring about the time line.

#### Will they give me an exact date?
Some companies may have a specific date that they plan to make a decision. If they are doing a mass hire or starting a training program by a certain time, they may have a certain day in mind to make their final decision.

They will also be considering the fact that even though they offer the position to someone, that person may not accept it! This could prolong the hiring process as they may offer the job to the next suitable candidate.

Not all companies and organizations will commit to having an “offer date”. If they are interviewing many people for the position, or if it is a newly posted job, they may not have a date set in place at that time.

If that is the answer you receive, you may ask if it would be acceptable to contact them some time after the interview.  

You will have their permission to do so and you will be able to find out when you would hopefully expect a job offer.

If you have been fortunate to interview with more than one company, you may find yourself in a situation where you have been offered a position with one company, yet have not heard back from another.

It would be appropriate to contact the company you are waiting to hear back from. You can inform them that another company (Company A) has offered you a position, but you would like to see if they (Company B) will be making their decision soon. Company B may be able to make their decision quickly. If not, you may need to either accept the offer from Company A, or decline it and hope that Company B offers you the position.
