Be sure to ask this one at the end of the interview as it will give the interviewer a final chance to ask any additional questions that may have come to mind during the interview.

The more they know about you and your skills, the more of a chance you will be offered the position.

You can position this question in several different ways. You can leave it simple as “do you have any further questions for me?”. Or, you can go a little further by asking if they have any concerns or hesitancy with offering you the position.

Both will bring the interviewer to ask you more questions. You will be able to sell your qualifications to them and show you are not afraid of feedback.

#### How will this help me?
This question shows you are not afraid of giving more details if they require them. You are not about to leave the interview without leaving everything on the table so they can make an informed decision about you.

If the interviewer has further questions, the answers you give may be the reason you get the job offer, or perhaps a higher opening offer.

The interviewer may ask you to elaborate on earlier information or scenarios you had discussed. They may also want to let you know if they have any doubts about your skills.

It is best to learn these now so you can address them and refute them. Addressing any concerns or hesitations will be a sign of a strong and confident employee.

It is better to state why you can do the job instead of not answering questions, leaving the interviewer thinking you would not be a suitable candidate for the position.

Being responsive to both positive and negative feedback and acknowledging what you may need to work on will benefit you both in the interview and in the position you seek.
