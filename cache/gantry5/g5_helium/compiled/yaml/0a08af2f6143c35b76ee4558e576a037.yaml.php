This attracts so much attention that asking questions at an interview is nearly forgotten.</p><p>This should not be the case! An interview is a two-way street. An interviewer expects that you will ask some questions and will often remember you more because of questions that you ask, than because of answers that you give.</p><p>Think for a moment about an extreme case of not having any questions at all. What would you think about a candidate like that, if you were the interviewer. Probably this person would appear lazy, unmotivated, and unprepared…exactly the opposite of someone you would want to hire.</p><p>You don’t want to appear like that yourself. On the contrary, you want the future employer to see you in best possible light.</p><h3>Three reasons why you must ask questions in an interview</h3><p>There are three primary reasons why you must ask questions in your job interview:</p><ol><li>Questions allow you to verify if the interviewer has any reservations about you. Consequently, you can remedy any concerns and leave the room with everyone feeling that you are a perfect candidate.</li><li>Your participation through questions breathes life into the conversation and demonstrates that you are truly interested in the job and the company.</li><li>Answers that you get allow you to make the decision if this is the place where you want to work. After all, you are interviewing your potential future employer as much as they interview you.</li></ol><p>There are thousands of possible questions that you can as interviewer, but whichever question you choose, it should be in line with at least one of these three objectives.</p><p>The following six chapters guide you through six different types of questions that you could ask in an interview. They all help you find if there is anything else you should explain or demonstrate to the interviewer, show your interest and make sure the company is right for you.</p><p>The next six chapters give you ideas for questions about:</p><ul><li>Job</li><li>Company</li><li>Requirements</li><li>Expectations</li><li>People and culture</li><li>Next steps in the hiring process</li></ul></div></div>'

If they are unable to do so, you can request them to forward you the information.</p><p>If your interviewer is at a loss, it could just mean that they have not prepared well.

You’ll want to leave the interview fully clear on expectations, rules, and procedures for the position.</p><h4>Travel Time</h4><p>If it has not already been made clear via the ad you are responding to or throughout the interview, then you definitely should ask about travel time.</p><p>Travel time directly impacts personal lives, and often not just your own. If you have a family, or are just starting out in life, travel time requires a period of adaption. If travel is required, you should be prepared for such before even taking the position on.</p><p>When you ask about travel time, be prepared to ask important follow-up questions.</p><p>Who will pay for your meals, and what does that process look like? Who will pay for hotel accommodations, and who is responsible for making those reservations? Is there further compensation for travel (i.e., do you get to keep your hotel points, rental car points, etc.)?</p><p>Also, you should be aware of how often you will be gone. Is it a weekly traveling gig? Monthly? Yearly? Clear that up before you exit the interview.</p><h4>Interesting Circumstances</h4><p>If this is a new position, your interviewer might not have a clear-cut answer for you.  If they are still formulating your new duties, they might have to get back to you.</p><p>Assure them that this is okay and that you understand. However, before you formally accept the position, be sure you are completely aware of your eventual requirements. Do not sign on if they are still unsure.</p>'

First, it will give you a good look as to what your office life will be like every day. Also, it will give you an idea as to how the office life changes throughout the course of a year.</p><p>By asking this question, you should gain a pretty good overview of the pace of the office, the type of work the office handles, and the general satisfaction of the employees.</p><p>Of course, this will lead you into asking more questions.

Do you like what you hear? Can you visualize yourself in that space every day, doing what they are asking you to do? If so, it looks like you are in the right place. If not, then it is certainly time to evaluate what your next step will be.</p>'

It opens the doors to co-workers having more light-hearted conversation and to think outside of the box. </p><p>The point is, you want to know whether and how you work encourages developing relationships, fostering your growth, and is dedicated to your success.</p>'
