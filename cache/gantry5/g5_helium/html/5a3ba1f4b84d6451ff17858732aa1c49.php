            <h3>Chapter 2:</h3><h2>Questions about the job</h2><hr><div class=\'g-grid\'>    <div class=\'g-block size-50\'>     <p>The first section covered why to ask questions in a job interview. That’s a fantastic first step, if you have a good and clear motivation to ask questions in your interview. This alone can already take you far, as you can come up with some good questions on the fly. </p><p>Now I’m going to crank it up a level by adding ideas for questions covering the job itself.</p><p>Since we’re talking about JOB interviews, there is no more natural way to start a real conversation with your interviewer than by talking about the job.</p><p>So to make sure you have what it takes, this chapter offers over a dozen of job-focused ideas for questions to ask in an interview. Many of these should be very use for you to take directly into use.</p>    </div><div class=\'g-block size-50\'><img style=\'margin: 7%;\' src=\'questions-to-ask-interviewer/job.png\'></div></div>
